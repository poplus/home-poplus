We have divided the current workload between a number of committees. These groups meet online (via Skype, Google Hangouts or other convenient technologies) at regular intervals, to discuss and divide up the work that needs to be done.

Committee membership is open to anyone, anywhere in the world. Just check our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/poplus) to find out when the next meeting of you chosen committee will be, and come along.

If you can't make it, don't worry - the agenda will be on a shared document that is open for your comments.

## Current committees

Looking for all committee documents? Here's [easy access to all agendas, minutes and other resources](http://hackfoldr.org/poplusteam/).

### Components committee

The Components group functions as an open space for developers working on, using or considering Components to share news, propose ideas, and help each other in their work. Its primary responsibilities are to certify software as Poplus Components and to generate interest in Poplus Components from developer communities.

For more information on what makes a Component, read [What is a Component?](http://poplus.org/components/definition/). You can also **[catch up on the group's latest meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16zq3lkLI05rZmO0hC5RZVErPts5065x4Gj5N_otn2As/view?pli=1&overridemobile=true#heading=h.qlwmoenuh7f3)**.

### Communications &amp; Events committee

This group has several responsibilities:

   * We set a strategy for outreach to potential members and member
     organisations.
   * We look after our website and social media.
   * There's a plan to make sure that members share their stories and
     experiences for the benefit of everyone.
   * We work together to run Poplus meet-ups, conferences and talks...
   * ...and also to make sure that we are represented at existing events.

We particularly welcome people from any country who are happy to go and talk
about Poplus at conferences or meet-ups. If you have translation skills, this
group wants to hear from you, too!

and 
**[notes from recent Communications meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bnq2xXRw5UMY376-zv626_7sPZRyWFzaKryNp723HUs/edit)** (we started as two separate committees, but we're one now).

### Governance &amp; Finance committee

Poplus won’t succeed if it doesn’t have a plan, and enthusiastic people who want to see that plan become reality. This committee brings together people from different countries and organisations who are working together to make Poplus succeed. Its responsibility is to ensure the success and well-functioning of Poplus. This largely involves supporting the other committees. It does this by:

* seeking funding to support the activities of other committees
* identifying outside opportunities for the committees to pursue to push Poplus forward
* facilitating “in-community” opportunities, helping members enjoy the benefits of Poplus
* monitoring committee activity and ensuring strong participation and motivation
* deciding on issues that cannot be resolved by the committees
