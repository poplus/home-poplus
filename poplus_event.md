#### What’s it About?

PoplusCon will bring civic coders, campaigners and activists from around the world together in Santiago for two days of events.  The aims of the conference are:

- **To introduce the Poplus concept**: How we can work together to build software that helps civil society groups and campaigners launch powerful websites - anywhere in the world.

- **To share stories and experiences**, both technical and non-technical, of running digital campaigns and sites

- **To introduce the first Poplus Components** - [WriteIt][writeit], [MapIt][mapit], [BillIt][billit], [SayIt][sayit], [VoteIt][developmentboard] and [PopIt][popit] and give practical advice and support to individuals/groups wishing to use them

- **To agree definitions for “Poplus Component” and “Poplus Application”**, and to provide support and advice to groups who want to adapt an existing tool for the project or build something new

- **To make connections between groups that might wish to work together in the future**



#### Who is it for?

Poplus is all about collaborating in the creation of civic digital tools to improve society. If you're interested in that aim, you should attend the conference.

You may be an individual, or working as part of a group. Perhaps you're developing tools for others to use, or you may be campaigners that need sites and tools built for you. Whatever the case, if you're interested in the benefits that collaboration can bring, you're welcome to attend.

#### What can I expect?

We’ll be working together in an unconference style so each attendee can propose sessions, talks and workshops. These will be spaces to share ideas on the future of Poplus, make suggestions for new components and, most importantly, forge the beginnings of a collaborative civic coding movement. 

This will be a place where people can come together to create and collaborate. We hope people will leave feeling inspired, with concrete ideas to engage their communities, and new connections that strengthen the network of people working for greater transparency and accountability.
