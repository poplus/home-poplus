# MapIt

MapIt is web service which makes it easy to find out which administrative area (i.e county, city, region) covers a particular point. It can be deployed locally and have local boundaries data uploaded, or you can use one of the deployments that already contains useful boundaries, such as:

+ covering the [UK][http://mapit.mysociety.org]
+ with OpenStreetMap boundaries for the [Earth][http://globa.mapit.mysociety.org]

MapIt uses a RESTful API and each page within a MapIt deployment contains both a human readable version, and JSON version for use by other computers.

Available as a package to install, or as an Amazon Machine Image, it’s easy to get started with quickly. It is mature, stable and widely deployed.
