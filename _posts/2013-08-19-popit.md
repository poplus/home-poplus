PopIt is a new web service tool currently in private Alpha, which makes it simple to start and maintain a public database of politicians and their basic biographic details, such as party memberships, birthday, employment history and contact details. A hosted version is currently being developed, so that anyone can make a new database instance to store their data in. Later we will take steps so that you can deploy PopIt locally. 

PopIt has been optimised for the messy, real world business of storing basic information about politicians. For example it can cope with people being known by several names, or having biographical details that are vague (i.e ‘went to University in the 60s’). It can also cope with people who change names, who change party and who have namesakes. 

Here is an example alpha public instance containing [Kenyan politicians][kenya].

All data can be both viewed by users, and extracted in JSON via the API. 

The design will be substantially improved soon, and we will re-enable users to make their own new instances.
