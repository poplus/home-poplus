PopIt makes it simple to start and maintain a public database of people, organizations and positions.
It can be used as a service on the [My Society hosted][popitweb] version or deploy in your own server.
Pop-it is flexible enought to store complete profiles, unaccurate data (e.g. A was born on 60's) and missing data (e.g. A dead ?), it's also capable of managing name changing, political party movements, etc.
