Poplus is still in its infancy. There's one thing it needs more than anything else: enthusiastic people!

* [Join a committee]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-involved/join-a-committee/)
* [Read our meeting minutes and agendas](http://hackfoldr.org/poplusteam/)
* [Get involved with code, events, and more]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-involved/other-ways/)
* [Where to find Poplus people]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-involved/find-people)
