## Propose a session

At PoplusCon, we'll be shaping the future of the *Poplus collaborative civic coding project*. By the end of the conference, we hope that all kinds of groups will be using, creating or collaborating on Poplus tools.

Sessions at PoplusCon will be proposed and facilitated by you, the participants. If you want to contribute to the conference agenda, check the selection criteria below, and complete [this form][form].

mySociety and Fundación Ciudadano Inteligente will select a number of the final sessions before the conference.  However, on both days of the conference, a third of the slots will be kept open so that attendees can propose sessions. There will also be lightning talks on both days: anyone can sign up to give one of these, at the conference.

Separately from the sessions we'll create a space where people can collaborate to build components and sites that use components. 

**We hope useful *connections* will form between technical and non technical groups.**
**We hope that you'll come away with a new *enthusiasm* for community-driven development.**
**We hope that the *tools* proposed will be developed further, taken up and used - because they fulfill a real need.** 



### Session Length
We'll be running up to three sessions in parallel, so attendees can pick and choose which topics suit them best. 

Sessions should be around **30-40 minutes long** and can be in any style or format provided that everyone attending can get involved - we won’t select proposals that are simply panel discussions, for example.

We’re aware there is not much time to submit sessions. But we know you’ll come up with some great ideas no matter what. We look forward to reading your submissions.

### How sessions are selected

If you’re submitting a proposal, the key questions we’ll be using to select the programme sessions are:

+ Would the session help other groups be more effective - through application of technology, campaigning or advocacy - in their field of operation?
+ Would the session help advance the Poplus network in some way? This could be through discussions on scope, focus, new components, how to network effectively across countries or similar ideas.
+ Would the session allow participants to engage with the idea, debate and dispute it?
+ Would the session offer PoplusCon participants a concrete, valuable outcome?

We hope that when you're selecting sessions on the day you'll also keep these in mind!

### Examples of Potential Sessions

Here are a couple of general examples of the type of sessions that are likely to be of interest to the conference attendees.

#### Data for Parliamentary Monitoring
If you want to run a parliamentary monitoring site what types of data do you need to get it up and running?  What are the challenges (both in terms of quality and availability) in getting hold of these data?  How have other people overcome the challenges?


#### Running projects effectively across different countries
If you have a tech team in one country and an activist team in another (or within the same country, but geographically separated), what are the challenges? How do you overcome them? What are the best ways to work together - Skype, face-to-face, hangouts? What experiences can you share? How can you make the best decisions about whom to work with?

#### A new component
You’ve got an idea for a great new component and you want to get feedback on it from the other interested parties in Poplus to help you refine and develop the concept. What do people think of the idea? How could it be used in different countries and contexts? How will it work with other poplus components? Can it just be standalone? What are the main features it will have and what need is it solving?

### Key Dates

Here are the key dates you need to know before you submit your proposal:
